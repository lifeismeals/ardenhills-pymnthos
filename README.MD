This is a short lesson plan devised to help new comers to 
get themselves quickly up to speed with python development.

Our reference text will be "Dive into Python3":

https://diveintopython3.problemsolving.io/

This book is a relatively quick read.

Some of the chapters, especially in the latter parts of 
the book are legacy related technologies that were included 
because they were in "Dive into Python 2".  

I recommend reading chapters 0 to 5,7 for exposition on 
basic syntax.  

If the reader has some lisp or scheme experience, then 
reading chapter 6 would also be helpful.  

Beyond that, chapters 9, 11 and 14 are especially 
important in the modern work force.  

Once you are through with the exercises in the book, 
this repo includes a list of beginner friendly projects 
that a novice can attack. 

I found exercises here to be pretty helpful to think about
programming:

It is advisable nowadays to have some proficency in how 
the web works.  Readers having completed chapter 14 of 
Dive Into Python3 should have a reasonable grasp of some 
fundamental concepts.  However, writing web services from 
scratch isn't the most efficient usage of resources.

A good framework in python for small web services is Flask.  

This tutorial is pretty comprehensive:

I would suggest a prospective student to turn some of 
the code from exercises and turn them into webservices.  

There are other tutorials for other frameworks.  I am 
concentrating on the python part of the backend stack for now.  
Other frameworks, e.g. Django, come with a great deal of builtin 
functionality and efforts will be spent to illustrate that if 
there is demand.
